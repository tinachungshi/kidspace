## Description
Created for parents, grandparents, and for the aunties and uncles around the world, Kiddy Space brings you a cleaner list of Ebay's best selling toys. For those of you who are tired of combing through Ebay's website for a present for your dearly beloved, Kiddy Space is here to offer you a hand.

Create an account, add items to your wish list, then when you're ready, take it on over to Ebay for the final payment. It's that simple!

## Getting Started
My website is deployed by Heroku [here](https://kiddyspace.herokuapp.com/).

And if you're interested in my Trello, check it out [here](https://trello.com/b/NGNdLLfn/project-4-kiddy-space).

## Icebox
1. Implementing a search feature for users to navigate through the items
2. Adding in more items and a pages feature

## Challenges
The MERN stack gave me some great difficulties, and I'm still reeling back from the effects of it, but I will not be deterred. I will conquer you one day Mr. Mern.

## Giving Thanks
A big thanks to the best teachers at General Assembly, Jim & Jon, and the best TAs, AJ & Jerry. I went in as a child, and now I emerge as a woman (wonder woman). 

Thanks for teaching me what I need to know and for never giving up on me.
